# GA-GNN: Geometric Algebra Graph Neural Network

This repository contains the implementation of GA-GNN models for "Design and Evaluation of a Geometric Algebra-Based Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction". 

## Files

- `GA_GNN`: Code for the models used in the main evaluation for each target.
- `Datasets.py`: Dataset class for QM9 with atomic numbers, positions, and edge vectors.
- `main.py`: Training and evaluation script.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for model and training parameters.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
